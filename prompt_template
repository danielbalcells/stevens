EXAMPLE TEXT:
###
Pedro Cano and I were talking about the electric car industry and he suggested that we rent a Tesla for our trip to LA with Alex and Enric. I’m finding it harder to hate things lately. I find it hard to sympathize with people who immediately assign malice to people or companies they know little about, instead of trying to understand what they might not know. Despite not being a huge fan of Elon Musk, I don’t feel the need to join the online polarization about him and transfer that energy to my impressions of a Tesla.
