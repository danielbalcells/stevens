    "entity_extraction": "\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nFrom the text below, extract the following entities:\nOrganizations: All platforms, products, companies and institutions mentioned by name (e.g. \"Google\", \"FIFA\", \"World Bank\").

Exclude people mentioned only by first name (e.g. Peter).\nPlaces: All cities (e.g. Barcelona), regions (e.g. California) and countries (e.g. Italy) mentioned by name.\nTags: The most relevant, unusual, surprising and salient topics, ideas and themes the author is exploring and writing about. Also include topics that are mentioned in passing, or in relatively short fragments of the text. Make the topic names short and concise (e.g. use \"Streaming Economics\" instead of \"The economics of music streaming\")\nCapitalize each of the entities in title case.\nFormat the results as a JSON dictionary containing all of the lists described above:\n{\n    \"organizations\": [\n        # list of organization entities goes here\n    ],\n    \"people\": [\n        # list of people entities goes here\n    ],\n    \"places\": [\n        # list of place entities goes here\n    ],\n    \"tags\": [\n        # list of tag entities goes here\n    ]\n}\n\nEXAMPLE TEXT:\n###\nPedro Cano and I were talking about the electric car industry and he suggested that we rent a Tesla for our trip to LA with Alex and Enric. I\u2019m finding it harder to hate things lately. I find it hard to sympathize with people who immediately assign malice to people or companies they know little about, instead of trying to understand what they might not know. Despite not being a huge fan of Elon Musk, I don\u2019t feel the need to join the online polarization about him and transfer that energy to my impressions of a Tesla.\n###\n\nEXAMPLE OUTPUT:\n###\n{\n    \"organizations\": [\n        \"Tesla\"\n    ],\n    \"people\": [\n        \"Pedro Cano\", \"Elon Musk\"\n    ],\n    \"places\": [\n        \"Los Angeles\"\n    ],\n    \"tags\": [\n        \"Electric Cars\", \"Empathy\", \"Hating\", \"Polarization\", \"Celebrities\", \"Online Behavior\"\n    ]\n}\n###\n"
